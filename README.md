# PowerPlantAnalysis
Simulates the Rankine Cycle in a power plant to optimize specified parameters

# Overview
This program was created for the final project of ME 123 - Engineering Thermodynamics at the University of Rochester.
Given initial temperature and pressure values, the program can simulate an isentropic single or double reheat Rankine Cycle in order to optimize one of: fuel cost, power output, environmental impact (CO2 emissions)
The library PyroMat was used to fetch thermophysical properties of water at various states, enabling the tracking of fluid properties at each stage of the cycle.
